## #2 The first part...

... is the worst part.

Today, I want to share a bit about my first coding experience. 

There are people who seem to be born with Java as their native language—teenagers writing Minecraft mods or students wrestling with languages like C# in their final exams. I **don't** count myself among these fortunate tormented souls. My first time coding? That was during my computer science studies.

I still remember how excited I was, *thrilled* at the prospect of finally programming something meaningful at the ripe young age of 23. But then reality hit: my first programming language was **Scala**. A language that ranks somewhere around page 12 of popular languages on Stack Overflow, probably useful in banks and still under [development](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/all.html). For a programming newbie expected to learn coding with it—and functionally at that—it was **an absolute nightmare**.

At this point, I'd love to say that I learned to love Scala, that the benefits of functional programming became clear over the trimester, and that I now enjoy working with it. But life isn't a fairy tale. Our professor traumatized us students, and I avoid Scala as much as possible. No one said it was supposed to be fun, but I never thought it would be so hard to get comfortable with a language or the logic of functional programming.

### What did I take away from this gloomy Scala period? 
Especially during your studies, it helps to program something entirely different that you actually enjoy - *not the Fibonacci sequence*. I think I just need time to heal so that nothing stands between Scala and me anymore.

In the spirit of the season, here's another little joke:

Why is Halloween like Christmas for programmers? 
*Because Oct 31 = Dec 25!*
