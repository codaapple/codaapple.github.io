## #1 Hello World!

Welcome to my very first blog post! I'd like to take you along on my journey into the world of programming and perhaps share a tip or two for aspiring developers.

Today, it's all about my own website: [zoewelli.de](https://zoewelli.de).

It was the first time I worked with so many different code snippets in languages like Ruby, YAML, and even pseudo-CSS. Navigating through this code jungle can definitely take time. So if you plan to work with web tools at this level, patience and perseverance are key — *but that's something you already know if you're into coding!*

Thankfully, [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) showed me how well it can all work together. It's an open-source tool integrated with GitHub that lets you create static websites.

[Devlopr](https://devlopr.netlify.app) by Sujay Kundu is quite an extensive project for a first personal website, but thanks to the extremely understandable code documentation, it's manageable.

It took me about a well focused weekend to get everything up and running. It's not all perfect yet, but I'm enthusiastically working on it.

By using Jekyll as a web tool, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with several new languages—and had a lot of fun doing it!

A big thank you to [@sujaykundu777](https://github.com/sujaykundu777) for providing this website using Jekyll.


Since it's October, here's a little joke to wrap things up:

What's a ghost's favorite data type? 
*The boo-lean!*
